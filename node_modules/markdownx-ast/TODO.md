# html handling



Build on top of marked's half-broken HTML parsing.






+ commonmarks' HTML handling is too crappy...

+ god html handling is confusing...

I don't really want to package Babel for the react markdown renderer.

Perhaps I could make a distinction between uppercase xml tag and lowercase...

```
<Bar>
behaves like heredoc.

recursively parse markdown content
<Qux>
  could nest... as long as it's a different component -.-
</Qux>
</Bar>
```


```
{component}
```


normal html:

```
<bar>
  blah blah blah
  blah blah blah
</bar>
```

i mean it doesn't have to be watertight.
